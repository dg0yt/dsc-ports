# dsc-ports

This vcpg registry contains vcpkg ports of Debian source packages,
and utilities for maintaining such ports.

It is intended to eventually support Linux, Android, macOS and MinGW for Windows.
Supporting MSVC for Windows might be added, however MSVC is assumed to be
sufficiently covered by the default VCPKG registry.
